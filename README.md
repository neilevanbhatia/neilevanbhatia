### 👋 Hi there 

I am a Data Scientist & Founder of LobbyingData.com.

In 2020, I founded LobbyingData.com, which aims to help journalists, academic researchers, and investors follow the money in politics in real-time, offering lobbying data and daily reports + a now-famous Twitterbot! The project uses data science techniques to automatically extract the most important details from lobbying filings, such as which companies are lobbying, the agencies they lobby, the names and work experience of the lobbyists they hire, and most importantly: the bills and specific issues on which they lobby.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins SAIS with a Master's in International Economics & Finance, and hold a Bachelor's in Economics from NYU. I attend UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science program concurrently while working.
